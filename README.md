GC Web API Standards
======================

Working requirements for Government of Canada APIs based on the [White House Web API Standards](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards)

Presently a Draft from the TBS Web Interoperability Working Group without a set deliverable date.  RFC to [WET - GC Web API Standards](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-api-standards).

## Style guide

For the remainder of this document code, arguments and other undefiend technical statements will be `code fenced` as to be easily distinguishable from standard text.

Arguments text will be used as follows:
* Arguments stated in the URL will be followed by an the equals sign '=' as `argument=`
* Arguments stated as a header will be followed by a colon ':' as `argument:`

## Standards

This document provides a standard along with examples for Government of Canada Web APIs, encouraging consistency, maintainability, and best practices across applications. Government of Canada APIs aim to balance a truly RESTful API interface with a positive developer experience (DX).

This document borrows heavily from:
* [The White House Web API Standards] (https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards)
* [Fieldings Dissertation on REST](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)
* [Designing HTTP Interfaces and RESTful Web Services](http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/designing-http-interfaces-and-restful-web-services)
* API Facade Pattern, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee
* Web API Design, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee
* Google Maps multiple language support

## Registration

( must be described. )

## Hypertext constraint

* The HTTP Header `accept:` is to be used to negotiate the API version and format:
   * `Accept: vnd.company.myapp.customer-v3+xml`
   * `Accept: vnd.company.myapp.customer-v3+json`

### Reverse DNS for Hypertext format

Pending communication with IANA regarding root registration of Hypertext definition the following is strongly recomended as the likely standard.

* For GC Hypertext the root is `ca.canada`
* Further organizational ownership, parent through children.  `nrcan.gsc.ess.chis`
* The api noun `earthquakes`
* The version `-v1`
* The format `+json`

For the examples listed above the complete Hypertext format would be

`ca.canada.nrcan.gsc.ess.chis.earthquakes-v1+json`

## RESTful URLs

### Standards for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.  Nouns have properties, verbs do not.
* Nouns should be plural as the resource to multiple instances of that noun.
* You shouldn’t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
* As a whole APIs should define complexity with multiple noun end points.
* URL v. header:
    * If it changes the logic you write to handle the response, put it in the URL.
    * If it doesn’t change the logic for each response, like OAuth info, put it in the header.
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list.
* Formats should be in the form of api/resource/{id}

### Good URL examples
* List of magazines:
    * http://example.gc.ca/api/magazines/
* Filtering is a query:
    * http://example.gc.ca/api/magazines?year=2011&sort=desc
    * http://example.gc.ca/api/magazines?topic=economy&year=2011
* All articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:
    * http://example.gc.ca/api/magazines/1234/articles
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list:
    * http://example.gc.ca/api/magazines/1234?fields=title,subtitle,date
* Add a new article to a particular magazine:
    * POST http://example.gc.ca/api/magazines/1234/articles

### Bad URL examples
* Non-plural noun:
    * http://example.gc.ca/magazine
    * http://example.gc.ca/magazine/1234
    * http://example.gc.ca/publisher/magazine/1234
* Verb in URL:
    * http://example.gc.ca/magazine/1234/create
* Filter outside of query string
    * http://example.gc.ca/magazines/2011/desc

## HTTP Verbs

Assuming dogs is a list of all dogs, dog id 1234 is an instance of dog named "Bogart"

| HTTP METHOD | POST            | GET       | PUT         | DELETE |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CRUD OP     | CREATE          | READ      | UPDATE      | DELETE |
| /dogs       | Create new dogs | List dogs | Bulk update | Delete all dogs |
| /dogs/1234  | Error           | Show Bogart | If exists, update Bogart; If not, error | Delete Bogart |

## Responses
* No values in keys
    * Good, `{ "name" : "Bogart", "breed": "Bulldog" }`
    * Bad, `{ "Bogart": "bulldog" }`
* No internal-specific names (e.g. "node" and "taxonomy term")
    * Good `{ "dog_id": 12345 }`
    * Bad `{ "did": 12345 }`
* Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set
    * Good, `metadata: { "count": 3, "next_dog": 1237 }`
    * Bad, `metadata: { "count": 3, "dogs": "1234,1235,1236", "breeds": "bulldog,mixed,poodle" }`

## Error handling

Error responses should include a common HTTP status code, message for the developer, message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined error number) and links where developers can find more info.

    {
        "status" : "400",
        "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
        suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
        "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
        "errorCode" : "444444",
        "more info" : "http://example.gc.ca/developer/path/to/help/for/444444,
        http://drupal.org/node/444444",
    }

General response codes are preferable where a clear code is not available.  General codes should serve for automated recognition of general state and propper error handling offer a path to resolution.

The three base states to recognize are success, improper request ( client error ) and internal server error ( API error ).  These better defined by the following HTTP Status codes:

* 200 - OK
* 400 - Bad Request
* 500 - Internal Server Error

## Official Languages

Best practice: For fields containing language content all languages are
returned in a nested manner with BCP-47 language codes used as keys.

    {
        "title": {
             "fr": "Levé LiDAR aux environs du Réserve de biosphere",
             "en": "Biosphere Reserve LiDAR Survey"
        },
        "resource_count": 5,
        "state": "active",
        ...
    }

Fields with values chosen from a limited set, such as "state" above, are represented with a single value.

### Filtering languages

Recommended: The languages returned may be filtered with a `lang=` parameter.
Multiple comma-separated languages may be passed.

Example: If `lang=fr` is passed to the API above it would return:

    {
        "title": {
             "fr": "Levé LiDAR aux environs du Réserve de biosphere",
        },
        ...
    }

## Versions

* APIs should always have a version number to maintain relation 
* Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’
    * Good: v1, v2, v3
    * Bad: v-1.1, v1.2, 1.3
* Major version numbers are required if a change can produce changes in logic
* APIs should be maintained at least one version back
* The HTTP Header "Accept" must be defined and accepted to negotiate the API version 
    * "Accept: application/vnd.company.myapp.customer-v3+xml"

## Record limits, offsets, cursors and metadata

These elements are to be added where possible and relevant.  Consideration for the client creates requierments such as moblie device limitations and dataset size.

### Limits

* If no limit is specified, return results with a default limit.
    * Sanity check to a reasonable return size
    * Sanity check to a reaonsable execution time
    * For small datasets limits may exceed row count

* Limits are row / object limits
    * The organization decides what is to be in a row or object
    * Limits apply to the topmost logical row or object

Limits are to be defined as the singular `limit=` followed by an integer.

### Offsets

Offsets apply to the structured data returned from the API distinct from internal indexing in the data.  For the purpose of explanation we'll assume rows/objects return are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the limit.

The general logic is to shift to what would be the subsequent entry by the offset ammount.  For a query that returns 1,2,3 an offset of 1 should return 2,3,4.

Offsets are to be defined as the singular `offset=` followed by an integer.

Example use:

* http://example.gc.ca/api/dataset?limit=25&offset=75
    * For row is base 1 rows 76 through 100 should be returned

### Pages

Much like offets defined above `page=` is an offset incremtented by the `limit=` argument.  If `limit=` is set to 25 and `page=` is set to 2 the total offset is 50, if the `page=` is set to 3 the total offset is 150.

Example use:

* http://example.gc.ca/api/dataset?limit=25&page=3
    * For row is base 1 rows 76 through 100 should be returned

### Cursor

`cursor=` is an offset with a value based on the sort order of results returned.

Use `cursor=` to reliably iterate over all results without risk of skipping or receiving duplicate rows/objects due to insertions/deletions happening at the same time.

The string value use with `cursor=` is returned in the metadata of each response when any rows/objects are returned.
Typically it is a single value copied from the last row/object, and could be a date, name, internal id or any other sortable type.

Example use:
* http://example.gc.ca/api/dataset?limit=25&cursor=20130101.010101
    * For 25 rows following the row containing the sort order value "20130101.010101"

### Metadata

Information relevant to record limits, offsets and indexes should also be included as described in the example resonse as a nested element.  Only relevant elements ( "count", "limit", "offset", "page" and "continueFrom" ) are required.

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 25,
                "limit": 25,
                "page": 3,
                "offset": 75,
                "cursor": "sam100890032"
            }
        },
        "results": [...]
    }

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 100,
                "limit": 100,
                "page": 2,
                "offset": 200,
                "cursor": "Smith, John"
            }
        },
        "results": [...]
    }

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 18,
                "limit": 25,
                "cursor": "20130101.010101"
            }
        },
        "results": [...]
    }
